### Lending Club Case Study

This is an exploratory data analysis of a large consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile. This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. The aim of this case study is to to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
